About

I’m a Computer Engineering graduate from York University with experience in building practical, user-centered software. My work spans full-stack web development, cloud integration, backend services, and IoT streaming pipelines, drawing on a solid background in Java, C, Python, and C#.

Through internships and projects, I’ve helped deliver production-ready features and developer tooling, including:

SafeScript – an award-winning VS Code extension for static analysis of C code, recognized for commercial potential.

Mindryx AI Study Platform – full-stack serverless quiz platform using AI to generate quizzes from PDFs or topics.

IoT real-time pipeline – streaming telemetry from devices into Azure SQL + ADLS, with ML-based anomaly detection and Power BI integration.

Azure Networking Environment – engineered secure, load-balanced multi-tier environments with Terraform and automated deployments.

I also mentored students in STEM, co-leading projects like building a DIY Micro:bit weather station and applying basic machine learning for disaster detection, while developing teaching content.
